# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Logan Monday

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 12, 2025.

## Log

### R1D1 
Wrote the CSS code for 2 FreeCodeCamp projects.

### R1D2
I created a project in HTML, and also made progress in my current project that I'm working on that's from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

### R1D3
I created the HTML for a personal website project I'm going to use as a portfolio website for my projects, and I completed very many steps in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum's project that I'm currently building, and only have a little more steps to complete before I finish the project I'm working on, and can, then, move onto the next project in the curriculum.
