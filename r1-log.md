# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Logan Monday

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 12, 2025.

## Log

### R1D1 
Wrote the CSS code for 2 FreeCodeCamp projects.

### R1D2
I created a project in HTML, and also made progress in my current project that I'm working on that's from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

### R1D3
I created the HTML for a personal website project I'm going to use as a portfolio website for my projects, and I completed very many steps in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum's project that I'm currently building, and only have a little more steps to complete before I finish the project I'm working on, and can, then, move onto the next project in the curriculum.

### R1D4
I added more HTML elements to the pages of my personal website project, as well as created a new page to include a link to my resume in the future once I've made it, but for now it informs visitors of what to do if they're looking for my resume in the meantime until I finish making it.
