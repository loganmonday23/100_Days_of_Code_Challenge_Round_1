# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 12, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I completed writing the CSS, and improving the HTML code for 2 of my FreeCodeCamp projects, and started another project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I did really well with the CSS for the 1st project.

### Day 2: January 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I completed 25% of the current project that I'm creating on FreeCodeCamp currently, and I also created a HTML project completely from the start to when I finished it in full.

**Thoughts**: I created an awesome project using HTML that was not all that difficult to create that I'm extremely happy with, and I made good progress on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and the current project that I'm creating from it.

### Day 3: January 20, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I began creating a personal website project using the HTML programming language to create the basic core structure of the content that will be included within the website, which is going to be my portfolio of projects I've created. I also completed many steps on the current project I'm building from the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and don't have very many more steps to complete in order for me to finish the current project I'm on completely, and will, then, be able to begin my next project that follows the 1 I'm doing, now, in the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

**Thoughts**: I created a really neat looking personal website that mentions a few different things about me, and also includes a photo of myself, and it was cool to see how the links, and setup of the website's core basic HTML code structure works as expected. Figuring out the CSS to write without being given the specific code examples that tell me exactly what CSS to write, such as, the properties, and the values for those properties for a rule given to certain selectors in the CSS code, is difficult for me to know how to write the CSS code when just given the instruction to in a way that doesn't give me the answer very specifically, but I was understanding a little of it, and figuring out some of the properties, and parts of the CSS code on my own with just the instructions that were provided that didn't provide the exact code to write for the value of properties for different selectors in the CSS code. I'm hoping that it won't be as difficult to learn CSS as I feel like it'll be.
