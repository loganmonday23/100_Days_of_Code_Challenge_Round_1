### Day 2: January 14, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I completed 25% of the current project that I'm creating on FreeCodeCamp currently, and I also created a HTML project completely from the start to when I finished it in full.

**Thoughts**: I created an awesome project using HTML that was not all that difficult to create that I'm extremely happy with, and I made good progress on the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, and the current project that I'm creating from it.
